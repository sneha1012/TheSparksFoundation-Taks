In this internship, we were provided a total of 6 Tasks and I was able to successfully complete all the 2 tasks within the given time-frame.

 
# Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)

Please click on the images on right side to view my solution.

Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
